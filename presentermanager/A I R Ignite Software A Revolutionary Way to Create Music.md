In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of A I R Ignite Software and show you how you can use it to make your own music.
  
## What is A I R Ignite Software?
 
A I R Ignite Software is a product of A.I.R. Music Technology, a company that develops professional virtual instruments and effects for Pro Tools and other DAWs. A I R Ignite Software is based on the same technology, but it is designed for musicians who want a simpler and more inspiring way to create music.
 
A I R Ignite Software is not a DAW. It does not have a timeline or tracks or lanes. Instead, it has a non-linear Arranger that lets you snap together individual musical ideas in pairs or groups to form entire songs. You can record, edit, and arrange MIDI clips using virtual instruments, effects, and Smart MIDI technology that assists you in creating chords, phrases, patterns, and complex arrangements.
 
A I R Ignite Software also makes it easy to share your music with others. You can export your songs to a sequencer or DAW if you want to further refine them, or you can upload them directly to SoundCloud, Facebook, email, and more from within the software.
