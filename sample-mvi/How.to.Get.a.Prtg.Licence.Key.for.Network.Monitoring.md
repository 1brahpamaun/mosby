To use Prtg, you need a licence key that matches your edition and number of sensors. A sensor is a basic monitoring element that can monitor one aspect of a device or service, such as CPU load, bandwidth usage, ping time, etc. Prtg offers three different licence editions: Trial Edition, Freeware Edition, and Commercial Edition.
 
## Trial Edition
 
The Trial Edition is intended for evaluation purposes and allows you to use an unlimited number of sensors for 30 days. You can request a trial licence key by clicking the Free Download button on the Paessler website[^1^]. The Trial Edition supports all available sensors and includes one single failover cluster with two cluster nodes. A cluster is a group of Prtg servers that work together to provide high availability and load balancing. After 30 days, the Trial Edition automatically turns into a Freeware Edition.
 
## Freeware Edition
 
The Freeware Edition is a good solution for starters or for private use. It is free for personal and commercial use and allows you to use up to 100 sensors. It also supports all available sensors and includes one single failover cluster with two cluster nodes. To use the Freeware Edition, you need to install the Trial Edition first and get a trial licence key. After 30 days, the Trial Edition automatically turns into a Freeware Edition.
 
## Commercial Edition
 
The Commercial Edition is suitable for customers and organizations of different sizes and needs. It allows you to use a maximum number of sensors depending on your licence type. You can see the pricing and sensor limits on the Paessler website[^1^]. The Commercial Edition supports all available sensors and includes one single failover cluster with two cluster nodes. You can also purchase additional licence keys to create clusters with up to four failover nodes.
 
## How to Enter a Licence Key
 
To enter a licence key, you need to access the Prtg web interface and select Setup | Licence Information from the main menu bar. Then click Change Licence Key and enter your licence name and key in the corresponding fields. The licence key is a string that consists of 10 blocks with six characters each[^3^]. After entering your licence key, click Save & Continue to activate your licence.
 
If you do not have internet access on your Prtg server, you can use the manual (offline) activation method. In this case, you need to generate an activation request file on your Prtg server and upload it to the Paessler website from another device. Then you will receive an activation response file that you need to download and import back to your Prtg server[^4^].
 
## Conclusion
 
Prtg is a powerful network monitoring software that requires a licence key to operate. You can choose from different licence editions depending on your needs and budget. To enter a licence key, you need to access the Prtg web interface and follow the instructions on the screen.
