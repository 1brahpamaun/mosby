There are different methods to remove retail demo mode on Oppo devices, depending on the model and software version of your device. Here are some of the common methods that you can try:
 
1. **Using a secret code.** Some Oppo devices have a secret code that can disable retail demo mode. To use this method, you need to dial `*#813#` on your device's dialer app and press the call button. This should bring up a menu where you can select `Disable Demo Mode`. After that, reboot your device and check if retail demo mode is gone.
2. **Using a PC tool.** Some Oppo devices require a PC tool to remove retail demo mode. To use this method, you need to download and install the [Oppo Demo Mode Unlock Tool](https://www.getdroidtips.com/remove-demo-mode-unlock-pattern-lock-oppo/) on your PC. Then, power off your Oppo device and press the Volume UP and Volume Down buttons together. Connect your device to the PC via USB cable and wait for the tool to detect it. As soon as you see the `Connected` keyword under the Status section, release both buttons. Then, click on `Remove Demo Mode` and wait for the process to finish. After that, reboot your device and check if retail demo mode is gone.
3. **Using a factory reset.** Some Oppo devices can remove retail demo mode by performing a factory reset. To use this method, you need to go to `Settings > System > Reset options > Erase all data (factory reset)`. Then, tap on `Erase all data` and confirm your action. This will erase all your data and settings on your device and restore it to its original state. After that, reboot your device and check if retail demo mode is gone.

Note that these methods may not work for all Oppo devices or software versions. If none of these methods work for you, you may need to contact Oppo customer service or visit an authorized service center for assistance.
